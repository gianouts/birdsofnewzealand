# birdsofnewzealand
A list of Birds of New Zealand with their scientific and common names. Collated to be used as a Custom Species list for BirdNET-Pi. This list ONLY includes birds that were in BirdNet-Pi's list, so it does not include all New Zealand birds.

When using BirdNet-Pi in New Zealand, the list of birds being used was constrained to those that had already been detected locally which wasn't many. Lowering of the Species Occurrence Frequency Threshold improved detection of birds however resulted in many false positives. As opposed to regularly adding birds to the Excluded Species list we decided to switch to using the Custom Species list.

This list was put together by going through https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=NZ and then adding them into BirdNET-Pi (where they existed in BirdNET-Pi). The file was also sorted.
